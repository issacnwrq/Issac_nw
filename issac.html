        <p>Please also note that I'm still learning how to code and there may be some bugs or things that may not work but <i>I'll will try to fix all of them.</i></p>
        
        <p><b><i>I started coding 2 days ago, the only reason why i started was because i was bored and this seem fun and addicting im still learning HTML, CSS and JS pretty easy.</i></b></p>


        <p><i>if you are wondering how long this took me, i would say 1 day since i had to fix problems and bugs which took me a while since im new to all of this coding stuff.</p></i>
